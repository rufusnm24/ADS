Temporal Analysis of Mass Shootings in USA

# Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research project "Temporal Analysis of Mass Shootings in the United States." This project is spearheaded by researchers Venkata Ajay Kumar Vuttya, Rufus Nemalikanti, and Nidhi Rastogi from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA. Our aim is to develop a comprehensive and predictive model that analyzes the temporal trends and sociopolitical dynamics of mass shootings in the United States.

This repository contains all the datasets and resources used in our study. The project leverages a combination of traditional time-series analyses and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to forecast the frequency and underlying drivers of these tragic events. Our goal is to inform public health strategies and policymaking, aiming at the prevention and reduction of future occurrences.
